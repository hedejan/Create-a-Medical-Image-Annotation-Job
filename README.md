## Project: Create a Medical Image Annotation Job
Given a dataset and business goal, design your own data labeling job using Appenâ€™s platform.

### Project Overview
Your goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that
* Can help flag serious cases
* Quickly identify healthy cases
* And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

### The Data
The dataset you'll be given is a modified version of this Kaggle chest x-ray dataset, with most labels removed. Every piece of data is a chest x-ray image. You may see images taken that are slightly different in size and taken under slightly different exposure times.

### What Does Pneumonia Look Like?
This is a challenging task because it is not always clear when pneumonia symptoms are present or not in an image. As such, your system is not meant to be a replacement for a doctor, only to aid in quickly identifying healthy patients and surfacing potential cases of pneumonia.

* A normal, healthy image will depict clear lungs without any areas of abnormal cloudiness/opacity; there may be structured, web-like vasculature in the lungs but otherwise that area should be clear. In healthy images, you are also more likely to see a diaphragm shadow.
* A pneumonia image may include a few things: areas of cloudiness/opacity in several concentrated areas or one large area. You may also see a general pattern of opacity that obscures the structure of the lungs, heart and diaphragm.

### Designing a Data Labeling Job
One of your biggest tasks will be to design an appropriate data labeling job using Appen's platform. You will need to submit an HTML file of a complete job Preview, which includes: 1. Instructions for annotation and 2. Example test questions. You will also need to submit a Proposal document that discusses the design of the job and steps you'll take for quality assurance.
